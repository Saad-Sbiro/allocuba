# Prompt for iOS 26 Glass Water Design System

Please provide detailed CSS styling specifications for iOS 26's liquid glass/water design system, specifically for bottom navigation bars. I need comprehensive technical details including:

## Required Information:

1. **Background Properties:**
   - Exact rgba() opacity values for glass backgrounds (light and dark modes)
   - Gradient configurations (linear-gradient angles, color stops, opacity at each stop)
   - Multi-layer background stacking order
   - Specific color values for water/glass theme

2. **Backdrop Filter Specifications:**
   - Exact blur() values in pixels
   - Saturation percentages
   - Brightness percentages
   - Any other backdrop-filter properties used

3. **Border Specifications:**
   - Border width in pixels
   - Border color rgba() values for all sides (top, left, right, bottom)
   - Border opacity for light and dark modes
   - Any border gradient effects

4. **Box Shadow Details:**
   - Complete shadow stack with all layers
   - Exact rgba() values for each shadow
   - Offset, blur radius, and spread values
   - Inner shadow specifications (inset shadows)
   - Shadow colors for glass refraction effects

5. **Color Palette:**
   - Primary glass colors (white/light mode)
   - Primary glass colors (dark mode)
   - Water/blue accent colors with opacity values
   - Highlight and glow colors

6. **Opacity Ranges:**
   - Minimum and maximum opacity values used
   - Typical opacity ranges for different elements
   - How opacity varies across gradients

7. **Visual Effects:**
   - Any pseudo-element effects (::before, ::after)
   - Radial gradients used
   - Any animation or transition values
   - Refraction and reflection effects

8. **Mobile Optimizations:**
   - Any performance optimizations for mobile devices
   - Reduced blur values for mobile
   - Simplified effects for smaller screens

## Output Format:

Please provide the information in a structured format that can be directly used in CSS, including:
- Complete CSS property values
- Comments explaining each property
- Light mode and dark mode variations
- Mobile-specific optimizations

## Context:

I'm implementing a bottom navigation bar that should look exactly like iOS 26's liquid glass design - transparent like glass mixed with water, with authentic Apple design language. The navigation should be nearly transparent but still maintain the glass morphism effect through backdrop filters and subtle shadows.

Please be as specific as possible with exact values, as I need to implement this precisely.
